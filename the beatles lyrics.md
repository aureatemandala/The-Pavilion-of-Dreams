So how could I dance with another (ooh)

That before too long I'd fall in love with her.

She wouldn't dance with another (whooh)

And I saw her standin' there.

Well, my heart went "boom,"

When I crossed that room,

And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night,
我们一整夜都在跳舞
And we held each other tight,
我彼此相牵紧紧的靠在一起
And before too long I fell in love with her.
没过多久我就坠入了她的爱河
Now I'll never dance with another (whooh)

Since I saw her standing there

And before too long I fell in love with her.

Now I'll never dance with another (whooh)
