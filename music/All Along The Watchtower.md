“There must be some way out of here,”

“这里一定有一条路能够离开”

said the joker to the thief

小丑曾对贼说，

“There’s too much confusion,

这里有太多的困惑

I can’t get no relief

我怎么也无法解脱。

Businessmen, they drink my wine,

商人们喝我的酒

plowmen dig my earth

农民们挖我的地

None of them along the line

他们之中无人能在此时此刻

know what any of it is worth”

理解那些事物的价值



“No reason to get excited,”

不需要那么激动

the thief, he kindly spoke

贼温和地说道

“There are many here among us

我们中有许多人觉得

who feel that life is but a joke

生活不过是个玩笑

But you and I, we’ve been through that,

但是你和我，我们已经超脱

and this is not our fate

我们的命运不该这样，

So let us not talk falsely now,

现在就别再空讲了

the hour is getting late”

时候已经不早



All along the watchtower,

沿着瞭望塔啊

princes kept the view

王子们注视着远方

While all the women came and went,

所有的女人熙熙攘攘

barefoot servants, too

赤脚仆人亦在其间

Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl

噢 凛裂的远方之外一只野猫在低声吼叫

Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl

两个骑士渐行渐近而狂风开始怒号
